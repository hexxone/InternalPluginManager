 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a class extending this class ({@link Event}).</li>
 * <li>Add a field named <code>HANDLERS</code> with the type {@link HandlerList}
 * that has the modifiers <code>private</code>, <code>static</code> (very
 * important!) and <code>final</code>.</li>
 * <li>Implement the method {@link Event#getHandlers()} and simply return the
 * field described above.</li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b> NOTE: Do NOT create the {@link HandlerList}-field in a non-static
 * context! This WILL break the functionality of the event system! </b>
